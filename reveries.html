                            <p>If I had to categorize ~Reveries~ as something, I think it'd be best described as an interactive short film. Really, it's more of a musical composition
                               with gamified elements - an experiment in the fusion of mediums. </p>

                            <p>My inspiration for this project comes from a couple of beloved animations, such as "Bao" and the opening scene from "Up". I noticed that due to the lack
                               of dialogue in these sequences, the underlying musical score was largely responsible for evoking an emotional response. Furthermore, I found the
                               effectiveness of the music to have derived from its perfect synchronization with the visuals - both in terms of aesthetic as well as timing with events. This led
                               me to wonder, though short film animations are typically regarded with respect to their visual narrative, perhaps their musical narrative is equally (if not more) fundamental and compelling </p>

                            <p>Thus, ~Reveries~ is an attempt to reframe the animation medium by letting the audio drive the visuals. I designed the system to be minimalistic and cohesive,
                               as the only control throughout the entire playthrough is pressing and releasing the spacebar to emit a chime. That way, the user has nothing to worry about other than
                               creating sounds. Regarding the visual and gamified components, they are quite literal in the sense that you are embodying a child who learns to play musical instruments and
                               falls in love with music as they continue playing over time. There's no way to lose - only ways to experience the music and narrative however one prefers. (For example, a friend
                               of mine spammed the spacebar during the full playthrough and said they liked it best that way!) </p>

                            <p>I think that as a proof of concept, ~Reveries~ succeeded in demonstrating the nuances
                               of such a system, as well as the limitations. For one, because the user is directly invested in the music making process, the experience feels more engaging. However, the
                               system is not interesting without novel ways of responding to audio cues; as it currently stands, I think ~Reveries~ is not fully there yet, and one flaw in my design
                               that I realized is keeping the controls too simple limits the range of expression I have to work with. As such, hypothetical next steps include giving the user more tools to
                               play with, so that while the big picture narrative remains consistently linear, perhaps the steps they experience along the way are more uniquely tailored to individual actions. </p>
